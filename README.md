## First data pipeline 

Let’s create our first data pipeline !

input.txt --> Data-pipeline --> output.txt

We’re going to write a program:
* it read the file input.txt
* it count the number of lines of the file 
* it write this number of line in a file output.txt

## Count the number of first names

In fact we have been asked to count the number of first names, in order to do that:
* we prepare a data pipeline to make the computation
* we document how the process work
* we ask another student to run the data pipeline
* the other student collect the list of first names on internet
* he store the list in input.txt and follow the proces
* he report how the process was documented and how it worked

## What did we learn ?
